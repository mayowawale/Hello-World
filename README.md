# Hello-World
Trying our Github, hoping to become a pro 
I am a microbiologist with few years experience as a Monitoring and Evaluation Officer (Volunteered)
My goal is to get my hands on available resources and train myself to become an excellent data scientist to contribute and improve services being rendered.
